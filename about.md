I am a self-motivated individual with a passion for developing technology that empowers people in their healthcare journey. As a versatile software engineer, I have experience in web application development, data analytics, data science, and distributed computing. I take pride in my work and thrive in a fast-paced environment. 

When I'm not building the future of health tech, you can find me either backpacking in one of California's beautiful National Parks or in the gym fine-tuning my muay thai technique.
